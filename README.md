This is the GitHub repository for Mah, Lohmueller, and Garud 2023, BioRxiv. The entirety of the project and the work that went into it is available via the commit history; however, for ease of viewing, we have organized the directory with helpful `.md` documents describing how to recreate the figures and tables in our study.

This directory includes the following subdirectories:

* [Analysis](./Analysis/README.md): Analysis of Data, as well as several `.md` documents describing how to reproduce each figure and table in the main text and supplement.
* [Data](./Data/READMD.md): Data and Results.
* [Scripts](./Scripts/README.md): Scripts used for analysis and plotting.
* [Summary](./Summary/README.md): Figures and Tables for inclusion in the main text, as well as intermediate output
* [Supplement](./Supplement/README.md): All supplemental tables and figures
* [microbiome_evolution_master](./microbiome_evolution_master/README.md): Inherited code from Garud and Good et al. 2019, PLoS Biology
