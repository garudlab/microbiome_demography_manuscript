# Data

In the course of revisions we augmented our initial dataset substantially. This repo now contains intermediate files necessary for [../Scripts/](`../Scripts/`). Empirical and model SFS's used in the final version of the manuscript can be found in [`../HighRecombinationAnalysis/`](../HighRecombinationAnalysis/) and [`../SupplementaryAnalysis/`](../SupplementaryAnalysis/)
