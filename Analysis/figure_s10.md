# Figure S10

[Supplemental Figure 10](../Supplement/Supplemental_Figure_10.jpg) shows a comparison of evolutionary summary statistics between core and accessory genes.

To recreate this figure, you must:

## Perform demographic inference using `Dadi`
  An example `.bash` script which performs demographic inference using `Dadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash`](../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## Fit the Distribution of Fitness Effects (DFE) using `FitDadi`
  An example `.bash` script which fits the DFE using `FitDadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_dfe.bash`](../Scripts/fit_dfe.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## [`generate_supplemental_figures.R`](../Scripts/generate_supplemental_figures.R)
  This `.R` script generates all Supplemental Figures and saves them to [`../Supplement/`](../Supplement/README.md).
