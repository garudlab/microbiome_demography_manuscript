# Figure S10

Supplemental Figure 10 shows the comparison of empirical site-frequency spectra with that of the model site-frequency spectra for a two-epoch demography fit to accessory genes, as well as the corresponding DFE's for the core and accessory genes of the 7 species for which we compared core and accessory genes in this study.

To recreate this figure, you must:

## Perform demographic inference using `Dadi`
  An example `.bash` script which performs demographic inference using `Dadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash`](../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## Perform demographic inference using `Dadi`
  An example `.bash` script which performs demographic inference using `Dadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash`](../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## Fit the Distribution of Fitness Effects (DFE) using `FitDadi`
  An example `.bash` script which fits the DFE using `FitDadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_dfe.bash`](../Scripts/fit_dfe.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
