# Figure S13

Supplemental Figure 13A shows the correlation between mean relative abundance and current effective population size. Supplemental Figure 13B shows the correlation between species prevalence and current effective population size.

To recreate this figure, you must:

## Perform demographic inference using `Dadi`
  An example `.bash` script which performs demographic inference using `Dadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash`](../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## [`generate_supplemental_figures.R`](../Scripts/generate_supplemental_figures.R)
  This `.R` script generates all Supplemental Figures and saves them to [`../Supplement/`](../Supplement/).
