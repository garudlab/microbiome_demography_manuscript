# Figure 1

[Figure 1](../Summary/figure_1.jpg) is comprised of several components.

Figure 1A shows the number of QP samples for the 39 most prevalent species in the datasets we analyzed.

Figure 1B and 1C show a simple cartoon schematic summarizing the process by which we compute SFSs from QP'd haplotypes.
