# Figure S5

[Supplemental Figure 5](../Supplement/Supplemental_Figure_5.jpg) shows the distribution of fitness effects under a neutral+gamma model specification over the core genes of the 39 species included in this study.

To recreate this figure, you must:

## Perform demographic inference using `Dadi`
  An example `.bash` script which performs demographic inference using `Dadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash`](../Scripts/fit_demographic_model.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## [`plot_likelihood.py`](../Scripts/plot_likelihood.py)
  As input, this script accepts a synonymous SFS file as specified in `Dadi` format, as well as the output `*demography.txt` from demographic inference. An example `.bash` script which computes likelihood surfaces for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/plot_likelihood.bash`](../Scripts/plot_likelihood.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## Fit the Distribution of Fitness Effects (DFE) using `FitDadi`
  An example `.bash` script which fits the DFE using `FitDadi` for all of the species analyzed in this paper can be found at [`../Scripts/fit_dfe.bash`](../Scripts/fit_dfe.bash). Uncomment appropriate lines to do so for core genes and for accessory genes.
## [`generate_supplemental_figures.R`](../Scripts/generate_supplemental_figures.R)
  This `.R` script generates all Supplemental Figures and saves them to [`../Supplement/`](../Supplement/).
